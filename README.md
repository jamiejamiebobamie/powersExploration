This project evolved to become a rogue-like action-adventure video game, called "Psychic Asylum".

The gameplay involves escaping an insane asylum for psychics. You play as one of three psychics or as one of the asylum guards.

The insane asylum is [dynamically generated](https://github.com/jamiejamiebobamie/ModularHallway/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/createAsylum/CreateAsylum.cs) before the start of every game and contains randomly placed scene objects that the psychics interact with when using their powers.

The powers include psychokinesis, telekinesis, and shapeshifting. And the guards have guns that shoot tranquilizer darts.

This was a first attempt at making a game in Unity and at the moment I am no longer working on it.

If someone would like to use my starter code to develop a more fleshed-out game, please feel free to, just cite your sources (and reach out to me!)
